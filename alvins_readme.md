# Rover Intern Summer 2022 Project

## Setup project locally


## Assumptions


## Approach
  - Read in given CSV file using command-line (i.e not inputs) and recreate their 'search algorithm' to create a new csv, sitters.csv, with the correct columns
  - Each important thing is separated by a comma in the CSV file (can probably use .split()) and note that first row is the 'header'
  1) Read through CSV file 
  2) Probably use a dictionary to store {email: [email, name, profile_score, ratings_score, search_score]} because the same person can sit dogs multiple times
  3) Fill in dict by using the correct indices, and update the scores when needed
  4) Use dict to output a new CSV called sitters.csv
